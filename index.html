        My name is James Thomson I was born on the February of 2003 in Edinburgh Scotland while on business trip with my family as my father studied medicine. My family comes from an extremely mixed nationality however, we mostly consist of Europeans. My education began in Kindergarten at glass street kinder, but moved to Kew East Primary from grade 1-4, from there my main education came from Trinity Grammar School from grade 5-12. I don’t speak any languages apart from my native language English. I’m primary a big gamer spending all of my spare time playing (I’m addicted), and because of my massive enjoyment from playing I’ve build a hobby around it, as well as a hobby of making and building pc’s for people in addition to programming and Servers.

        My main interest for IT began when I was young as I always enjoyed being near computers and electronics, I don’t know why I have such enjoyment of these things but always gave me happiness. I believe it’s because of how much I game on these devices and from this I’ve had a long experience with devices such as computers, servers, electronics, and hardware. I’ve built many PC’s in my life as well building servers for hosting windows users and/or gaming servers. I’ve made robots and programs for both hardware and software, simply because of the enjoyment of seeing a finished product.

        I chose to come to RMIT because of simply my ATAR, to be brutally honest I wanted to study medicine at Melbourne University but due to the unfortunate 2 years of both year 11 and 12 from covid as well as family issues, it didn’t do me good mentally. However, I first heard of RMIT from my Careers councillor and promoted my ability to do well in this specific course out of my pour interest in IT as I’ve done all courses promoting this in my school. Since it fitted into my designated ATAR, I chose to do IT full time at RMIT.

        I expect to learn different types of professions in IT as well as a pathway into Software Engineering. I want to learn primarily programming but expect to learn all required aspects to becoming a IT professional and land myself a Job in a Tech industry. I’m most looking forward to developing AI as I have a fascination with it and its concept. I find it extremely cool to watch visually as a bot learns and creates neural links. I hope by the end of these three-year course to understand what it takes to be in the IT industry and how to be properly ready for a IT role.
