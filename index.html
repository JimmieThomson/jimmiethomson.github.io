        My name is James Thomson. I was born in the February of 2003 in Edinburgh, Scotland, while on a business trip with my family as my father studied medicine. My family comes from a highly mixed nationality; however, we primarily consist of Europeans. My education began in Kindergarten at glass street kinder, but I moved to Kew East Primary from grade 1-4; my leading education came from Trinity Grammar School from grade 5-12, primary year 12 subjects being Physics, Methods, Chemistry, English and Software Development. I do not speak any languages apart from my native language English. I'm primarily a big gamer spending all of my spare time playing (I'm addicted). Because of my immense enjoyment from playing, I have built a hobby around it and a hobby of making and building PCs for people in addition to programming and Servers.

        My main interest in IT began when I was young. I always enjoyed being near computers and electronics; I don't know why I have such enjoyment of these things, but it always gave me happiness. I believe it's because of how much I game on these devices. I've had a long experience with computers, servers, electronics, and hardware devices. I've built many PC's in my life and built servers for hosting windows users and/or gaming servers. I've made robots and programs for hardware and software simply because of the enjoyment of seeing a finished product.

        I chose to come to RMIT because of simply my ATAR. To be brutally honest, I wanted to study medicine at Melbourne University. However, due to the unfortunate two years of both years, 11 and 12, from covid as well as death, it didn't do me good mentally. However, I first heard of RMIT from my Careers councillor. I promoted my ability to do well in this specific course out of my interest in IT as I've done all courses promoting this in my school. Since it fitted into my designated ATAR, I chose to do IT full time at RMIT.

        I expect to learn different types of professions in IT and a pathway into Software Engineering. I want to learn primarily programming but expect to learn all required aspects to becoming an IT professional and land myself a job in the tech industry. I'm most looking forward to developing AI as I am fascinated with it and its concept. I find it extremely cool to watch visually as a bot learns and creates neural links. By the end of this three-year course, I hope to understand what it takes to be in the IT industry and how to be properly ready for an IT role.
