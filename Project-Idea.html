        <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The automatic desk draw is an initiative product in conception. It allows for ease of use for storage and storage locations, such as a search bind to a particular draw. A prominent example throughout this overview will be primarily based on the use of tools. As such, the auto-desk strives to be a complementary device used in addition to products used in an industry where lots of different tools are needed and need to be found efficiently. The simple way of explaining it is that consumers use the product to store certain items in different draws. When storing, they can add that tool to that draw using a GUI that remembers where it is stored. A user can search for that item, and when found, the draw automatically opens, pointing to that draw.</p>

        <h2>Motivation</h2>
        <p>The product's motivation is to serve hundreds of thousands to millions of people who need an organization with tool-based products and other products to customers' needs. This is a universal tool to it not just mainly used for one group of products but will be mainly encouraged for people who need tool organization which currently has a market value of 41.94 billion. However, the fundamental motivation is the imitativeness of the product as there are no products like this on the market yet, which will allow for products to be sold at a more significant load. Motivation comes with a cost as well. I do not want the product to be too expensive as it will deter people from buying it.</p>

        <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
        <h2>Automatic draws</h2>
        <p>The automatic draws allow the device to be opened and closed with a push of a button through the GUI or physically. The draws are to be designed to make the user's life a little easier; however, primary, it is for the search user on the GUI on the system as instead of indicating where the draw is on in the system, it opens the draw instead to indicate where that thing is. Ease of use is a big thing with this product as it is the critical component, so the cost must be kept to a minimum with how they work. Using a raspberry pi or an Arduino that allows for wireless communication, they will be connected to a servo motor to a link of clogged teeth. The servo will move in a clockwise or anticlockwise motion to move the draw to open or close. When using the product's GUI, the draw will be the motor's set code (This is random and will be MOTDR-1 or MOTDR-2).</p>

        <h2>Wireless</h2>
        <p>The wireless aspect of the draws is for ease of use. The product will be primarily controlled from a GUI; the GUI needs to be external rather than internal. This is to reduce cost, as adding an internal screen will need more time and money to install and use. The system will run on a website via a raspberry pi, as both python and HTML can work in unison. It can be the software of where the GUI is controlled from, such as an app or exe; however, for time’s sake, this extends how long it will take to make this product and increase the cost.</p>

        <h2>Finding UI / GUI</h2>
        <p>The UI or GUI will be where the most user interfacing will happen. When a user needs to open a draw or search for a specific item, the GUI will allow the information to be displayed on which item is where. The GUI is not for searching, however, as it also acts as a hub to all your needs, such as opening and closing draws, adding items to the search list with the drawer code, and any external customizable such as RGB.</p>

        <h2>Open-Source Code</h2>
        <p>The reason for this implementation is for the user's need. Restricting the users to use the provided software can cause issues, such as customization not being an option or software does not work to the users' needs, so additional code must be required for that to happen. The downside to this issue is security, as any open software has to a product. However, this is not an issue since the HTML website will only be hosted locally, not publicly.</p>

        <h2>Storage</h2>
        <p>The draws are designed to have at least eight draws, all with the exact set dimensions. The reason for 8 is because it accompanies any person wanting to use the product by adding a large amount of space. Eight draws allow for four on each side.</p>

        <h1>TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES</h1>
        <p>The main component of the product is the raspberry pi. The raspberry pi allows for a website to be hosted on a network (LAN) to the user's Wi-Fi. A mixture of HTML, CSS, and python will be used to process the user's requests into code and transfer it to the other hardware. The HTML raspberry pi must accommodate the search bind, input for the draw, locate button and open and close button for a draw. Most preferably, this is displayed in a picture UI; however, it can be changed if there is a set deadline. The hardware used for the opening and closing will be a set of 8 servo motors; these motors will move clockwise or anti-clockwise and be connected to a set of teeth allowing it to move the draw to open or close. The motors must have a calibration option inside their software that performs a check to see how much they move to open and close fully. In addition, an Arduino might be used to make things more accessible with the other electronics; however, it cannot be said if they will be used or not.</p>

        <h1>SKILLS REQUIRED</h1>
        <p>Skills include the following, Hardware programming, HTML, CSS and Python programming (possibly c# programming) and designing/engineering.</p>
        <p>Hardware programming must be used as it allows for the hardware components to move, such as the servo motors and calibrating. HTML and CSS are needed because we need to design the website to accommodate the user’s aesthetic and efficiency requirements. Python so the inputs given by the user to the HTML can be transferred into readable code and scripts to allow for specific actions to be transferred. C# in case of hardware not working as intended and Arduinos needing to be used. Designing/engineering is used to form and build the table to both fit the hardware as well as allow it to work as a draw for consumers' needs.</p>

        <h1>OUTCOME</h1>
        <p>If the outcome is successful, the product expects to fix the common problem of forgetting where something is. Tools, clothes, keys, or anything commonly lost or forgotten will be fixed. The product aims to remember those everyday things for you, so you do not. It will help users look for specific tools and boost efficiency and effectiveness for whatever they need. The impact will be minimum to the world; however, it will eliminate potential problems with losing simple products.</p>
