        <p>The results show I’m an above average person in creativity which means I like to be more creative than to be forward thinking towards a task given to myself. I’m auditory in learning style than in visual, which means instead of seeing something and writing it down I’m more capable to hearing something and it to be more easily remembered.  Lastly my personality type shows I’m an open person and have lots of energy and assertive person which tells me I much rather be in a place where I’m more talking to people than not. </p>

        <p>In a team environment my results demonstrate that in ability to think outside of the box is above average, which is good in situation where a problem cannot be solved in conventional ways, allowing for an alternative. As well as being in a position in a team where my thoughts and feelings can be heard easily in a project allowing for another voice to be added to a project plan output, such as a consumer product of planning of that said product.</p>

        <p>When forming a team with this test, it indicates I need people who also have the same output as myself or more. As doing so a lot more thinking and arguments can arise to develop a better product for the betterment of the customer. Although this way of thinking in a team can be less efficient it can be more effective in the product life span and output.</p>
