        <p>The results show I am an above-average person in creativity, which means I like to be more creative than forward-thinking towards a task given to me. Iâ€™m more auditory in learning style than in visual, which means instead of seeing something and writing it down, I am more capable of hearing something and being more easily remembered. Lastly, my personality type shows I am an open person with lots of energy and an assertive person, which tells me I much rather be in a place where I am more talking to people than not. </p>

        <p>In a team environment, my results demonstrate that inability to think outside of the box is above average, which is good in a situation where a problem cannot be solved in conventional ways, allowing for an alternative as well as being in a position in a team where my thoughts and feelings can be heard easily in a project allowing for another voice to be added to a project plan output, such as a consumer product of planning of that said product.</p>

        <p>Forming a team with this test indicates I need people who also have the same output as myself or more. As doing so, a lot more thinking and arguments can arise to develop a better product for the betterment of the customer. Although this way of thinking in a team can be less efficient, it can be more effective in the product life span and output.</p>
