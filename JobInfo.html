        <p>The position is to develop code in to suit times and scheduling of flights and the cabin and crew for Qantas. The code must be written in python and used in addition to the domain specific language rave, or as the information provided says “development of applications that optimise the planning of flight and cabin crew schedules and rosters across the Qantas Group”. The skills required for this specific job application is the knowledge of in-depth Python coding language in addition to the domain-specific RAVE to solve in depth problems in planning and scheduling. The list says a person must have a degree in Software Development, IT or Aviation. I do not have a qualification in all of these but have extensive experience in python and other languages such as C#, java, C++ and Lua.

            For me to achieve these skills and qualifications is by first achieving a degree in IT of which I’m already doing that would take three years to achieve. Then following on with that familiarise myself with the language RAVE as the advertisement states this would most likely take me two weeks to a month to understand. Once I’ve done so I should be able to successfully implement myself into this role.
