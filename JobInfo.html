        <p>My ideal job is to be a software engineer in a big or small tech firm. That have predictable hours and a good workspace to be in. So, because of my interest of software programming as well as aviation I’ve found a job application. I’ve chosen the <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56384056?type=standout#sol=afa9047c76136e09b59601bc42d4bff8436bc1f7">Qantas software developer advertisement</a> as my ideal job application. The position is to develop code to suit the times and scheduling of flights and the cabin and crew for Qantas. The code must be written in python and used in addition to the domain-specific language rave, or as the information provided says, “development of applications that optimise the planning of flight and cabin crew schedules and rosters across the Qantas Group”. The skills required for this specific job application are the knowledge of in-depth Python coding language and the domain-specific RAVE to solve in-depth problems in planning and scheduling. The list says a person must have a degree in Software Development, IT or Aviation. I do not qualify for all of these. However, I have extensive experience in python and other languages such as C#, Java, C++ and Lua.</p>
        <p>To achieve these skills and qualifications is by first achieving a degree in IT which I’m already doing that would take three years to achieve. Then following on with that, I familiarised myself with the language RAVE as the advertisement states; this would most likely take me two weeks to a month to understand. Once I’ve done so, I should be able to successfully implement myself into this role. Familiarising being making and coding in the language RAVE with possible outcomes I may be tasked with. Thus, at least having a understanding knowledge for the role.</p>
        <p>Outside of Qantas role I want a job that has a key interest in Employer well-being, basically a role where I’m treated well in a community of workers no matter the differences in personality. In addition key things I’m interested in, in a role is the diversity of work flow, I don’t want to just be working on one thing, instead I’m looking for the ability to move into other projects that are different in style one I’ve finished the first.</p>
